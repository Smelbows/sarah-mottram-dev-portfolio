My portfolio

This is a portfolio webpage to show what I have been working on recently, tech I have worked with, repos that I'm most proud of, and some thoughts I have about web development. My contact details for LinkedIn, StackOverflow and Github can also be found here.

# What I did:

I used a figma design template created by Technigo as the basis for the design of this page. I started by spending some time looking at this design and recreating the HTML elements that would be needed for each section. After I had the skeleton HTML I started to style the page, starting with the outer elements and working my way in. I then added my own content and the JavaScript that I wanted.

I'm happy that the JavaScript adds to the page but the page would still work and look perfectly fine without it.

# Accessibility:
My HTML contains no aria attributes despite this project being an opportunity to consider accessibility. The reason for this is that I consider them to be a tool to be used as an exception, only when it is absolutely impossible for some reason to use descriptive and semantic HTML, which accessibility tools have been specially designed to interact with. I have focussed on using only the right HTML elements, and I have styled around them, rather than it being my styling that forces me to use inferior HTML.
